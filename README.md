# Distraction host file

## About

Using DNS66 or other tools I am slowly building a list of sites that continue to distract me in my day to day. Whilst these can be circumvented easily enough, it takes several actions... enough time to think... "Do I really need to access this site right now?"

## Usage

Through an app like DNS66 or via your HOST file... be careful, you should know what you are doing when editing the host file.
